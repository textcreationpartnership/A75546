            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Arguments again≈øt all Accommodation and Treaties betweene the City, and the ingaged Grandees of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Army.</head>
            <p n="1">1 IT will neither be ≈øafe nor honourable, for ≈øo great a City to accommodate and joyne intere≈øt with a con≈øpiring Party, that by frequent violations of their faith and duty, have in≈ølaved King, Parliament, City and Kingdome, and broken the Faith of this Nation given to the Scotts in the large Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in the Nationall Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By accommodating with them, you make all their crimes your owne, their ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty being to involve you to joyn with them in defence of their crimes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Scotti≈øh Quarrell is not again≈øt the Engli≈øh Nation, but again≈øt the trecherous and hypocriticall Grandees, who by perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them≈øelves, and ≈øati≈øfying their ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both unto Kingdome and Army, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117647:3"/>
the Souldiers by fal≈øe ≈øugge≈øtions from disbanding, and totally ob≈øtructing Irelands relief; and al≈øo a con≈øpiring party in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who keep them up to make good the afore≈øaid crimes, forcing what Votes they plea≈øe to pa≈ø≈øe, by over-awing the Parliament: witne≈ø≈øe Cromwells laying his hand upon his ≈øword, and forcing the Hou≈øe to pa≈ø≈øe tho≈øe traiterous Votes again≈øt the King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their owne con≈øciences, Allegiance, Prote≈øtations, Vow and Covenant, and to rai≈øe Taxes upon the people, which they ≈øhare among≈øt them≈øelves. This warre is not likely to be of any continuance, con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering there being in the Army many con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious men, who have had ≈øuch ample ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the fal≈øhood of their Grand Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that they are not like to hazard their lives againe under the command of ≈øuch grand Impo≈øtors as they are; al≈øo knowing the generall hatred of the Kingdome to them under who≈øe in≈øupportable burdens and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsions it groaneth. Nor have wee any way to break the power of the ≈øaid Grandees of this Army but by the Scots, whereby the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117647:3"/>
ju≈øt Rights and Intere≈øts of all three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes may be ≈øetled, and Ireland relieved: all which the Scots have declared in their former Papers delivered to both Hou≈øes of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If you accommodate with this Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you mu≈øt have the ≈øame friends and foes with them, as well as the ≈øame ≈øinnes and quarrells; and then it will grow to a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Quarrell between England &amp; Scotland, which will be of long continuance and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery: and the Intere≈øt of the King and his Children, and of all Princes of Chri≈øtendome concerned in the example, will be carried on in the Kingdome of Scotland again≈øt you, if you joyn with tho≈øe beggerly Grandees who have inriched them≈øelves and their fellow-Impo≈øtors by the ruines of the Kingdome. You will lo≈øe your credit and intere≈øt with your friends and Brethren of Scotland; the onely feare and terror of who≈øe coming into England kept this Faction (which all men know is never ≈øatisfied with money &amp; bloud) from taking many of your innocent heads from off your ≈øhoulders: and confi≈øcating
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117647:4"/>
your e≈øtates to pay the arreares of the Army: witne≈ø≈øe their often ≈øpeeches to this purpo≈øe in the Hou≈øe of Commons, and their illegall and violent proceedings again≈øt you: you will likewi≈øe lo≈øe all the people of England.</p>
            <p>I have ≈øhewed you your lo≈ø≈øes; let mee ≈øhew you your gaines by this accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that by comparing one with the other, you may ca≈øt up your accompt, whether you ≈øhall be gainers or lo≈øers by it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They offer you the Tower of London, and your Militia to be re≈øtored (things of no great con≈øideration) and your Aldermen and Citizens to be ≈øet at liberty: they do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to disband their Armie, which makes them Lord it over you, and over-power both Tower and Militia; and when they have divided you from all your friends, and de≈øtroyed your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are ≈øecure from the Scots, the ≈øame violence which at fir≈øt took your Tower, your Militia, and your mo≈øt hone≈øt Citizens from you, can deprive you of them all againe at plea≈øure, when you ≈øhall have none to ≈øtick by you: your obligations to them ≈øhall be of ≈øteele, theirs to you but of ≈øtraw: he that gives mee that he can deprive me of at plea≈øure, gives me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Party know your City to be the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117647:4"/>
entire ≈øtrength of England. In <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. daies, (when it was not halfe for great and populnus as now) it ≈ølew <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and routed his rabble, ≈øix times as many in number as the Army. They therefore feare you, and con≈øequently hate you, and labour nothing more then to divide and weaken you, which is their proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt: for which purpo≈øe (to divide the City in it ≈øelfe) they cau≈øed the Parliament to change your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia into other hands: they cut off We≈øtmini≈øter, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, and the Hamlets from your <hi>Militia,</hi> to weaken it, they have divided you from the Parliament, they have endeavoured to divide the Country from you; <hi>Ut dividendo ≈øingula, imperent univer≈øis.</hi> Wherefore the Army in their Remon≈øtrance 7. Decemb. 1647. in≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently demand Reparations from the City to the Country adjacent, for above 100000. l. lo≈ø≈øe ≈øu≈øtained through the Armies attendance on the Cities defaults; which was a device only to make the Country quarrell with the City, and to make the Army Vmpiers.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Con≈øider, you ≈øhall joyne with them that never keepe Faith longer then they may gaine by it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you have many examples. Any hone≈øt man may be deceived once, but he is a foole that will be deceived twice by one man.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Nay you cannot treat with the≈øe men, nor give them a Common Councell, or Hall, without lo≈ø≈øe and danger: They have alwaies made lies their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and built their de≈øignes upon the ≈øandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Rumors and Tables.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Glover</hi> already give out, that they and you are as good as agreed, that you differ only upon a puntilio of honor, which will ≈øoon be reconciled: what is the meaning of this? but that they (have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117647:5"/>
creatures of their owne, Commi≈ø≈øioners in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) they have adverti≈øment to ≈øpread the ≈øame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports there, thereby to take off the edge of your friends affections; to lay an imputation of incon≈øtancy upon you, and make you incon≈øiderable in the judgements of your be≈øt friends, and retard all indeavours for your ≈øuccour. In the meane time, this party hath blocked up all pa≈ø≈øages to Scotland, that truth can have no acce≈ø≈øe to you, and you have only ≈øuch newes as Darby-hou≈øe doth plea≈øe to impart to you. The≈øe men have commited tho≈øe crimes that cannot be ≈øafe without commiting greater: they mu≈øt on headlong: goe not with them for company; they de≈øire to be≈øtow their plague-≈øores upon others. Let it not trouble you, that the Parliament hath approved their ≈øub≈øcription of the Ingagement with the Army; it was a Vote extorted in a thin hou≈øe, many Members having beene driven away by threats of the Army before; and there were many di≈ø≈øenting Members. A little patience and con≈øtancy will ≈øettle you in a la≈øting peace.</p>
            <p>To petition the Hou≈øes to repeale their foure Votes again≈øt the King, is to ≈øave their reputation, that ≈øeeke to de≈øtroy yours.</p>
